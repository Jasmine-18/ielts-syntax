1|fluency in coherence it is extremely coherent and well thought outs and the speech rates and the speech continuity are both outstanding some over use of like that that's a good good question at the start but she overcame that as we got into more difficult questions there was none of that repetition so that is impressive actually lexical resource is a 7 there's a wide range of vocab used with some degree of flexibility and Precision to handle basically any topic there's enough idiomatic and also some less common words I suppose the weak link at 6 let's just say it's not bad but it's not much with the same degree of accuracy or Distinction as the other criteria there is a mix of simple and complex structures though the complex structures are definitely not as correct or as precise as the simple ones so that as a result there's not too many hour freeze sentences and there's a lot of Future simple using will like the answer will be yes when we should just say the answer is yes' pronunciation is a seven pronunciation is quite impressive as well it's clear it's smooth it's well articulated it's natural I would caution Mia against speaking too fast the times is it and see the rush and for the words to come out a little bit kind of almost jumbled in it maybe in her enthusiasm to answer the questions which is not a bad thing at all but I would just caution her slow it down a bit apart from that it's pretty there's not much syllable timing I meant to say it syllable timing is mechanical stress timing is smooth and fluent and she achieves that really well with chunking and intonation that makes her engaging to listen to so at 7 all in all it's a profile of 8767 which is overall of course enough to achieve a 7 nice job thank you
2|appropriate language you definitely don't need to improve pay store increased the pace but it's hard to think of how you can take it up to the nine level because it is it's right you just even more coherent topic development or extension and you could be looking at a 9 to
3|7 for fluency fluency is a really good example to others she just you know lost her way for a moment or two and still came back from that and still made a lot of sense with our answers and was prepared to and willing to an able to develop an extend her responses and basically almost always find a way to keep going you get a 64 lexical resource because you can describe a range of topics and make yourself clear not always with the best word choices array grammar can you use a mix of simple and complex sentences which absolutely need to be present even for a 64 the flexibility wasn't always there and then the pronounced that brings us to the pronunciation which actually was quite good arrange of features including the chunking and rhythm and sentence stress and even intonation that you need sure it can be a little bit patchy or variable and control is not always consistent but that needed to be an obstacle if you easily understood 7 for fluency 6 for Lexicon 6 for grammar 7 for pronunciation gives you a 6.5 so all in all great job Kelly
5|2/7 and 8 and 68 is 4 fluency in coherence which was outstanding not only do you use this horse markers because like I mentioned before I don't know whether it was I would say those connectors conjunctions but you also don't really pause or hesitate for anything other than content not language and the topic development is like we mentioned us to it's more very coherent logical package allocation just looking at some of the inaccuracies it was things like word formation now wait formation is a bit grammar a bit vocab it's hard to separate but then it's going virally that's understandable actually why you would use an adverb but actually we just say viral things go viral that's it you know also Prospect all I think you said at the end now that's not a word I think I'm not sure if you were trying to say they're a good prospects or prospective which is looking to the Future the government should invest some sources to the film industry now clearly you mean resources not sources resources invest in not invest 227 in grammar you do have a wide range of structures no doubt but like that said before 50% range 50% most stands out to me is plurals the overuse of plurals information which is not a word because information is uncountable and then you use good qualifications like I can gain a lot of inspiration from this film instead of inspiration a lot of more abstract are nouns are uncountable you know these people conceptual nouns motivations chunking stress timing which basically means suitable rhythm only one word that was pronounced which was the place name
6|pretty good pretty good standing actually because in terms of obviously you're able to get very long and well-supported responses which you just have a lot of very situationally appropriate cohesive features there's a lot of cohesive features or discourse markers it's when you say things like is the thing I have to say that after the advantages it seems very well structured and very well signed posted let me see if there's any errors in that area I don't think it's very many hours in that area at all actually no I'm not that luxury guy I'm not that luxury guy there are a few errors at the end of the day you're range see it's 50% range 50% accuracy and that is true for electrical resource vocab it's also true for grammar now you can sometimes make up in range what you like in accuracy and I think the range of your vocab are offsets or outweighs the a few mistakes not that luxury guy well I think that guy is a very gender term just as a woman you would say person or I'm not that I'm not a luxury type maybe you would use type yeah I'm not like retired I'm not someone who goes in for luxury you know yeah that's it about the way right because I would say a lot of students and even native speakers get this wrong they say comparison up in the dictionary it's actually comfortable yeah learn the multi-culture was another one multiculturalism or you learn about the variety of cultures yeah multiculturalism is an abstract noun meaning the concept multicultural is not really a word in itself even though it's an understandable error I know by the rules this no one ever availables and more current events and all that it seems to be a lot clearer because it's maybe a lot of presents yeah no one can join me while I was alone say again it doesn't match up all it's not consistent nobody can join me while I'm alone nobody was able to join me or nobody could while I was alive that's it it's got a match it's got a match when I was not when I was not in Warren's it yeah in Warrington prepositions at that period know in that period and maybe maybe over use of that for certain things as well you know I don't think we can suggest much for pronunciation for pronunciation results which would be 7.75 very safe and secure OK Google pronounciation just want it comfortable and then what do you think I think that is very smooth with me very clearly flexible
